### Project Overview
The first project aims to analyze and visualize the sales performance of a retail store by exploring and uncovering key insights in the sales data. Weâ€™ll use Excel for initial exploration, SQL to answer business questions, and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that presents our findings. The analysis will cover top-selling products, regional performance, monthly sales trends, and other key performance metrics.
The second project,customer data for a subscription service to identify segments, patterns, and key trends in customer behaviour. By exploring data related to subscription types, cancellations, and renewals, we aim to develop actionable insights that help improve retention and inform marketing strategies. The final deliverable will be an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes customer segmentation and subscription trends.

### Data Sources
The primary source of Data used in this project Capstone project.xlx and this is open source data that is freely downloaded from an source such as Canvas LMS

---
### Tools Used
This project utilizes the following tools and technologies for data analysis and visualization:
- Microsoft Excel: For initial data exploration, pivot tables, and calculations (e.g., average subscription duration, subscription patterns).

### Project one: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
 #### Microsoft Excel
The first step is to load the sales data into Excel and perform an initial exploration using pivot tables and formulas.
#### Tasks
##### Summarize Total Sales:
- Use pivot tables to calculate total sales by:
-  Product
-  Region
-  Month
##### Calculate Key Metrics:
- Use Excel formulas to calculate:
- Average Sales per Product (using AVERAGEIF)
- Total Revenue by Region (using SUMIF)
- Create Additional Reports:

##### Explore other interesting metrics that can provide more insights, such as:
- Monthly sales growth
- Top-selling products over time
- Seasonal sales patterns

### Conclusion
1. The Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store project enabled a comprehensive examination of the storeâ€™s sales data, revealing key insights into top-selling products, regional sales performance, and monthly sales trends. By leveraging Excel for data exploration and metric calculations, SQL for querying specific sales insights, and Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard, we were able to uncover actionable insights.
2. The interactive Power BI dashboard provides a clear overview of sales performance, highlighting top products and key regions while enabling stakeholders to drill down into monthly and regional trends. This analysis equips the retail team with data-driven insights to optimize inventory, tailor marketing efforts by region, and focus on high-performing products to drive growth.
Overall, this project demonstrates the value of a structured approach to data analysis. It combines multiple tools to transform raw data into strategic insights that support more informed decision-making and promote stronger sales performance.

3. The Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service project provided valuable insights into customer behaviours, subscription patterns, and trends in cancellations and renewals. By leveraging Excel, SQL, and Power BI, we identified key customer segments and the most popular subscription types, calculated average subscription durations, and highlighted regional differences in subscription trends.
The Power BI dashboard enables stakeholders to interactively explore and monitor subscription metrics, helping them make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention, tailor subscription offerings, and target marketing efforts effectively. Insights gained from this analysis can guide strategic initiatives to enhance customer engagement and optimize revenue growth.
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in understanding customer segments, optimizing services, and ultimately supporting a more customer-centric business model.
