# LITA_PROJECT

### Project Title: sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store and Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service

### Project Overview
The first project aims to analyze and visualize the sales performance of a retail store by exploring and uncovering key insights in the sales data. Weâ€™ll use Excel for initial exploration, SQL to answer business questions, and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that presents our findings. The analysis will cover top-selling products, regional performance, monthly sales trends, and other key performance metrics.

The second project,customer data for a subscription service to identify segments, patterns, and key trends in customer behaviour. By exploring data related to subscription types, cancellations, and renewals, we aim to develop actionable insights that help improve retention and inform marketing strategies. The final deliverable will be an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes customer segmentation and subscription trends.

### Data Sources
The primary source of Data used in this project Capstone project.xlx and this is open source data that is freely downloaded from an source such as Canvas LMS

### Tools Used
This project utilizes the following tools and technologies for data analysis and visualization:
- Microsoft Excel: For initial data exploration, pivot tables, and calculations (e.g., average subscription duration, subscription patterns).
- SQL Server: For data storage, querying, and extraction of key insights through SQL queries.
- Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards to visualize customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends.
- Github for Portfolio Building

 ### Microsoft Excel

#### Project one: sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
The first step is to load the sales data into Excel and perform an initial exploration using pivot tables and formulas.
#### Tasks
##### Summarize Total Sales:
- Use pivot tables to calculate total sales by:
-  Product
-  Region
-  Month
##### Calculate Key Metrics:
- Use Excel formulas to calculate:
- Average Sales per Product (using AVERAGEIF)
- Total Revenue by Region (using SUMIF)
- Create Additional Reports:

##### Explore other interesting metrics that can provide more insights, such as:
- Monthly sales growth
- Top-selling products over time
- Seasonal sales patterns

  #### Data Visualization
  ##### Pivot Tables

### SQL Analysis
 Import the sales dataset  SQL Server environment and write SQL queries to answer specific business questions. This step provides a deeper understanding of the data and reveals additional insights.
- Queries to Complete
Total Sales by Product Category: Retrieve the total sales for each product category to identify high-performing categories.

--- SQL
