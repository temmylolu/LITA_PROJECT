### Project Title: sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store and Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service

### Project Overview
The first project aims to analyze and visualize the sales performance of a retail store by exploring and uncovering key insights in the sales data. Weâ€™ll use Excel for initial exploration, SQL to answer business questions, and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that presents our findings. The analysis will cover top-selling products, regional performance, monthly sales trends, and other key performance metrics.

The second project,customer data for a subscription service to identify segments, patterns, and key trends in customer behaviour. By exploring data related to subscription types, cancellations, and renewals, we aim to develop actionable insights that help improve retention and inform marketing strategies. The final deliverable will be an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes customer segmentation and subscription trends.
